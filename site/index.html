            NOTE:
            1. I wasn't sure if React Js was supposed to be used. Otherwise i would have tried with react-stomp module. 
            2. I have kept the jQuery implementation as Commented section, as i first implemented it using jQuery but wasn't 
               sure if jQuery is aso not allowed,so used JS instead.
            3. I had some concerns regarding sparkline as i didnt get what exactly was expected. Hope my implementation will
               suffice. The sparkline will get updated every 30 secs based on lastest 5 midprice values.
            4. I have kept basic css as it is to keep it simple. Definitely, the table can be enhanced to look better.
            5. As i am using Stomp for the very first time, i think there can be better way of handling and logging errors.
